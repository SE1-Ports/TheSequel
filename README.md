# Serious Sam: The Sequel

This repository contains code for **Serious Sam: The Sequel** modification by **JesterOfDestiny** that is ported onto a fork of a modern SDK for classic Serious Sam games.

The code is based on frequent updates that are posted on the [project page](https://jesterofdestiny.itch.io/serious-sam-the-sequel-public-beta) in a form of simple archives. The purpose of this repository is to port the code onto a more convenient platform and to keep track of all changes between updates.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is **NOT** an official repository for the mod's source code! All of the encountered issues should be reported to the original author!
